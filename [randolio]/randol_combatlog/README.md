# Randolio: Combat Log

**ESX/QB support with bridge**

I was working for a server that had a paid script that was meant to function the same but it was broken, escrowed and I couldn't see the code to actually fix it so I ended up just making my own. The script simply creates a ghost-like clone of the player when they drop from the server holding a board that states their information and reason for dropping. You can target the clone to copy information from the player in the case that you need to report someone for combat logging etc. OX/QB target is supported.

Support is not provided as it works out the box for both frameworks.
