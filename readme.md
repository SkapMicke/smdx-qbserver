### Why We Modified Some QBCore Scripts
We replaced some of QBCore's basic scripts to enhance the server's appearance, liveliness, and uniqueness. Below is a short explanation of how the server is built. Feel free to modify it as you wish!

## [QB]
In the QB folder, you will find all the original QBCore scripts with some modifications:

- **qb-core:**
  - `functions.lua`: Modified for our notifications
  - `config.lua`: Modified for md-drugs
- **qb-ambulancejob:** Modified for the death screen. To revert to the original, remove "majestic-deathscreen" and redownload qb-ambulancejob.
