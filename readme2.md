# Server Info
Thanks for reading our readme file! We wanted to create a prebuilt server that's almost done. The only thing you need to do is to modify it to your liking!
We have used scripts from multiple different creators, And we have given all those creators credits in the "readme2" file. Thanks again!
We just want to help people with this. And give people a easier start if you don't have good knowledge with this. We will always provide support in our discord!

We have aimed to create a unique but simple prebuilt/start server, which is why we have replaced some of QBCore's original scripts with others. We have also selected high-quality scripts from other creators and developed our own resources for this server.

If you got any suggestions on updates or how we could do a better layout for this server, Feel free to open a ticket in our discord.

  - Ox_doorlock works better for our needs.

- **Instead of qb-prison, we use pickle_prisons!**
  - The original is boring, and Pickle's system is better.
